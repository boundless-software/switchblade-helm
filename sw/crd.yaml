                            requests and limits) known to Kubernetes describing a single container in
                            each pod of the current scale target (e.g. CPU or memory). Such metrics are
                            built in to Kubernetes, and have special scaling options on top of those
                            available to normal per-pod metrics using the "pods" source.

                                Optional duration in seconds the pod needs to terminate gracefully upon probe failure.
                                The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent
                                a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal.
                                Set this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your process.
                                If this value is nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this
                                value overrides the value provided by the pod spec.
                                Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately via
                                the kill signal (no opportunity to shut down).
                                This is a beta field and requires enabling ProbeTerminationGracePeriod feature gate.

                            RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                            This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                            For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                            the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                            Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                            this init container will be continually restarted on
                            exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                            containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                            will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                            is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                            container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                            for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                            container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                            init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                            completed.

                      List of ephemeral containers run in this pod. Ephemeral containers may be run in an existing

                      creating a pod, and it cannot be modified by updating the pod spec. In order to add an
                      ephemeral container to an existing pod, use the pod's ephemeralcontainers subresource.

                        An EphemeralContainer is a temporary container that you may add to an existing Pod for
                        user-initiated activities such as debugging. Ephemeral containers have no resource or
                        scheduling guarantees, and they will not be restarted when they exit or when a Pod is
                        removed or restarted. The kubelet may evict a Pod if an ephemeral container causes the
                        Pod to exceed its resource allocation.

                        To add an ephemeral container, use the ephemeralcontainers subresource of an existing
                        Pod. Ephemeral containers may not be removed or restarted.

                      init container fails, the pod is considered to have failed and is handled according

                      Init containers may not have Lifecycle actions, Readiness probes, Liveness probes, or Startup probes.
                      The resourceRequirements of an init container are taken into account during scheduling
                      by finding the highest request/limit for each resource type, and then using the max of
                      of that value or the sum of the normal containers. Limits are applied to init containers
                      in a similar fashion.

                            RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                            This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                            For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                            the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                            Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                            this init container will be continually restarted on
                            exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                            containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                            will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                            is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                            container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                            for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                            container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                            init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                            completed.

                                The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent
                                a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal.
                                Set this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your process.
                                If this value is nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this
                                value overrides the value provided by the pod spec.
                                Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately via
                                the kill signal (no opportunity to shut down).
                                This is a beta field and requires enabling ProbeTerminationGracePeriod feature gate.

                            between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                            The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                            or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                            labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:

                            - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                            scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                            violate MaxSkew(1).
                            - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                            When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence

                            Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                            And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                            this value has no effect on scheduling.
                            As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                            scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                            If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                            Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                            When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                            labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                            | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                            |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                            The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                            In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                            because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                            it will violate MaxSkew.

                            This is a beta field and requires the MinDomainsInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).

                              but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
                              skew.
                            A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
                            if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate

                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                            labelSelector spread as 3/1/1:

                            If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
                            to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
                            MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
                            won't make it *more* imbalanced.

                          description: |-
                            ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                            The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                            and deleted when the pod is removed.

                            Use this if:
                            a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                            b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                               tracking are needed,
                            c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                            d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                               a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                               information on the connection between this volume type
                               and PersistentVolumeClaim).

                            Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                            APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                            of an individual pod.

                            Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                            be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                            more information.

                            A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                            persistent volumes at the same time.

                                Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                                An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                This field is read-only and no changes will be made by Kubernetes
                                to the PVC after it has been created.

                                        if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                        compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                        both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                        value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                        When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                        dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                        There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                        * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                          allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                        * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                          preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                          specified.
                                        * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                          in any namespaces.
                                        (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                Tip: Ensure that the filesystem type is supported by the host operating system.
                                Examples: "ext4", "xfs", "ntfs". Implicitly inferred to be "ext4" if unspecified.

                      of balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node will deliver
                      traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading
                      the client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints will
                      be dropped.) The default value, "Cluster", uses the standard behavior of

                      features). Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP from

                      a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account

                      The primary use case for setting this field is for a StatefulSet's Headless Service to

                      The Kubernetes controllers that generate Endpoints and EndpointSlice resources for
                      Services interpret this to mean that all endpoints are considered "ready" even if the
                      Pods themselves are not. Agents which consume only Kubernetes generated endpoints
                      through the Endpoints or EndpointSlice resources can safely assume this behavior.

                      "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing

                      routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
                      "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                      (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                      as the clusterIP.

                            each pod of the current scale target (e.g. CPU or memory). Such metrics are
                            built in to Kubernetes, and have special scaling options on top of those
                            available to normal per-pod metrics using the "pods" source.

                      ExternalIPs, and LoadBalancer IPs). If set to "Local", the proxy will configure
                      the service in a way that assumes that external load balancers will take care
                      of balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node will deliver
                      traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading
                      the client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints will
                      be dropped.) The default value, "Cluster", uses the standard behavior of
                      routing to all endpoints evenly (possibly modified by topology and other
                      features). Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP from
                      within the cluster will always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients sending to
                      a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account
                      when picking a node.

                      "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing

                      allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather
                      than a virtual IP.

                      routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
                      "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                      (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                      as the clusterIP.

                      will fulfill this Template, but have a unique identity from the rest
                      of the StatefulSet. Each pod will be named with the format
                      <statefulsetname>-<podindex>. For example, a pod in a StatefulSet named
                      "web" with index number "3" would be named "web-3".
                      The only allowed template.spec.restartPolicy value is "Always".

                                                MismatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select which pods will
                                                be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                                incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `LabelSelector` as `key notin (value)`
                                                to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration
                                                for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                                pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                                The same key is forbidden to exist in both MismatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.
                                                Also, MismatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set.

                                        preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                        container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                        PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                        container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                        period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                        or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                    RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.

                                    For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                                    the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                    Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                                    this init container will be continually restarted on
                                    exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                    containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                    will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                    is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init

                                    container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                    init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                    completed.

                                user-initiated activities such as debugging. Ephemeral containers have no resource or
                                scheduling guarantees, and they will not be restarted when they exit or when a Pod is
                                removed or restarted. The kubelet may evict a Pod if an ephemeral container causes the
                                Pod to exceed its resource allocation.

                                    cannot be resolved, the reference in the input string will be unchanged. Double $$ are reduced
                                    to a single $, which allows for escaping the $(VAR_NAME) syntax: i.e. "$$(VAR_NAME)" will
                                    produce the string literal "$(VAR_NAME)". Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless
                                    of whether the variable exists or not. Cannot be updated.

                                        The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent

                                        The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent
                                        a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal.
                                        Set this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your process.
                                        If this value is nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this
                                        value overrides the value provided by the pod spec.
                                        Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately via

                              for when the pod needs a feature only available to the host user namespace, such as
                              loading a kernel module with CAP_SYS_MODULE.

                              Init containers are executed in order prior to containers being started. If any
                              init container fails, the pod is considered to have failed and is handled according
                              to its restartPolicy. The name for an init container or normal container must be
                              unique among all containers.
                              Init containers may not have Lifecycle actions, Readiness probes, Liveness probes, or Startup probes.
                              The resourceRequirements of an init container are taken into account during scheduling
                              by finding the highest request/limit for each resource type, and then using the max of
                              of that value or the sum of the normal containers. Limits are applied to init containers
                              in a similar fashion.
                              Init containers cannot currently be added or removed.

                                        PreStop is called immediately before a container is terminated due to an
                                        API request or management event such as liveness/startup probe failure,
                                        preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                        container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                        PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                        container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                        period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                        or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                    For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                                    the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                    Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                                    this init container will be continually restarted on
                                    exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                    containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"

                                    is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init

                                    for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                    container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                    init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                    completed.

                                    MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                                    When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                                    between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                                    The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                    or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                    For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                    labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                    In this case, the global minimum is 1.

                                    |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                                    - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                    scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                    violate MaxSkew(1).
                                    - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                                    When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence

                                    MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                                    When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                    Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                    And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                    this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                    As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                    scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                    If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                    Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                    When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                                    For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                    labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                    | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                    |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                    The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                    In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                    because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                    it will violate MaxSkew.

                                    We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number

                                        fsType is the filesystem type of the volume that you want to mount.
                                        Tip: Ensure that the filesystem type is supported by the host operating system.
                                        Examples: "ext4", "xfs", "ntfs". Implicitly inferred to be "ext4" if unspecified.

                                        Examples: For volume /dev/sda1, you specify the partition as "1".
                                        Similarly, the volume partition for /dev/sda is "0" (or you can leave the property empty).

                                  description: |-
                                    ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                                    The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                                    and deleted when the pod is removed.

                                    Use this if:
                                    a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                                    b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                       tracking are needed,
                                    c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                                    d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                       a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                       information on the connection between this volume type
                                       and PersistentVolumeClaim).

                                    Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                                    APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                                    of an individual pod.

                                    Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                                    be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                                    more information.

                                    A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                                    persistent volumes at the same time.
                                  properties:
                                    volumeClaimTemplate:

                                        Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                        The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                        owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                        pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                        `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                        entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                        is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                                        An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                        will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                        volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                        the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                        meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                        owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                        this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                        manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                                dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                                volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                                core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                                When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                                the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                                provisioner.
                                                This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                                if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                                compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                                value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                                When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                                There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                                * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                                  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                                * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                                  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                                  specified.
                                                * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                                  in any namespaces.

                                                (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                                If specified, the CSI driver will create or update the volume with the attributes defined
                                                in the corresponding VolumeAttributesClass. This has a different purpose than storageClassName,
                                                it can be changed after the claim is created. An empty string value means that no VolumeAttributesClass
                                                will be applied to the claim but it's not allowed to reset this field to empty string once it is set.
                                                If unspecified and the PersistentVolumeClaim is unbound, the default VolumeAttributesClass
                                                will be set by the persistentvolume controller if it exists.
                                                If the resource referred to by volumeAttributesClass does not exist, this PersistentVolumeClaim will be
                                                set to a Pending state, as reflected by the modifyVolumeStatus field, until such as a resource
                                                exists.

                                        Tip: Ensure that the filesystem type is supported by the host operating system.
                                        Examples: "ext4", "xfs", "ntfs". Implicitly inferred to be "ext4" if unspecified.

                              description: |-
                                dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                provisioner.
                                This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                  specified.
                                * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                  in any namespaces.
